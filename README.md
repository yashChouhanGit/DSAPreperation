# DSAPreperation
A dedicated lab for mastering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms. Beyond "accepted" submissions, I focus on logical rigor and interview readiness. I’m building muscle memory to translate complex problems into optimized, "Swifty" machine logic.  🔹 Goal: 1+ Problem Daily 🔹 Focus: O(n) Efficiency 🔹 Language: Swift 5.10+


🚀 Swift DSA: The Daily Grind
"One problem a day to keep the unemployment away."

Welcome to my dedicated technical repository for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This is a living laboratory where I document my journey toward computational efficiency, logical rigor, and technical interview readiness.

In the fast-paced world of software engineering—particularly within the Swift ecosystem—writing code that simply "works" is the bare minimum. This repository is dedicated to the pursuit of code that is performant, readable, and Swifty. By committing daily, I am building the muscle memory required to deconstruct complex problems and translate them into optimized machine logic.

🎯 The Mission
My objective is to solve at least one high-quality problem every 24 hours. Through this consistency, I am honing three critical pillars of engineering:

Pattern Recognition: Identifying underlying archetypes like Sliding Windows, Two Pointers, and Dynamic Programming.

Complexity Analysis: Every solution is strictly evaluated using Big O Notation. I prioritize moving from O(n 
2
 ) brute-force to O(n) or O(logn) optimized algorithms.

Swift Excellence: Leveraging Swift’s robust type system, Generics, Guard statements, and high-order functions to ensure solutions are idiomatic.

📂 Repository Structure
The repo is organized by category to act as a searchable library for future review:

📂 Arrays-Strings/ — Pointer manipulation and hashing.

📂 Linked-Lists/ — Reference types and memory logic.

📂 Trees-Graphs/ — BFS, DFS, and Recursion.

📂 Dynamic-Programming/ — Optimization via memoization.
